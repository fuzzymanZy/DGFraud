<p>A Deep Graph-based Toolbox for Fraud Detection
</h3>

**Introduction** 

**DGFraud** is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based toolbox for fraud detection. It integrates the implementation & comparison of state-of-the-art GNN-based fraud detection models. The introduction of implemented models can be found [here](#implemented-models). <!-- (Add introduction blogs links). -->

We welcome contributions on adding new fraud detectors and extending the features of the toolbox. Some of the planned features are listed in [TODO list](#todo-list). 

If you use the toolbox in your project, please cite one of the two papers below and the [algorithms](#implemented-models) you used :

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/safe-graph/DGFraud.git
cd DGFraud
python setup.py install
```
### Requirements
```bash
* python 3.6, 3.7
* tensorflow>=1.14.0,<2.0
* numpy>=1.16.4
* scipy>=1.2.0
* networkx<=1.11
```
## Datasets

### DBLP
We uses the pre-processed DBLP dataset from [Jhy1993/HAN](https://github.com/Jhy1993/HAN)
You can run the FdGars, Player2Vec, GeniePath and GEM based on the DBLP dataset.
Unzip the archive before using the dataset:
```bash
cd dataset
unzip DBLP4057_GAT_with_idx_tra200_val_800.zip
```

### Example dataset
We implement example graphs for SemiGNN, GAS and GEM in `data_loader.py`. Because those models require unique graph structures or node types, which cannot be found in opensource datasets.


### Yelp dataset
For [GraphConsis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00625), we preprocessed [Yelp Spam Review Dataset](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/yelpchi-dataset/) with reviews as nodes and three relations as edges.

The dataset with `.mat` format is located at `/dataset/YelpChi.zip`. The `.mat` file includes:
- `net_rur, net_rtr, net_rsr`: three sparse matrices representing three homo-graphs defined in [GraphConsis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00625) paper;
- `features`: a sparse matrix of 100-dimension Bag-of-words features;
- `label`: a numpy array with the ground truth of nodes. `1` represents spam and `0` represents benign.

To get the complete metadata of the Yelp dataset, please send an email to [ytongdou@gmail.com](mailto:ytongdou@gmail.com) for inquiry.

## User Guide

### Running the example code
You can find the implemented models in `algorithms` directory. For example, you can run Player2Vec using:
```bash
python Player2Vec_main.py 
```
You can specify parameters for models when running the code.

### Running on your datasets
Have a look at the load_data_dblp() function in utils/utils.py for an example.

In order to use your own data, you have to provide:
* adjacency matrices or adjlists (for GAS);
* a feature matrix
* a label matrix
then split feature matrix and label matrix into testing data and training data.

You can specify a dataset as follows:
```bash
python xx_main.py --dataset your_dataset 
```
or by editing xx_main.py

### The structure of code
The repository is organized as follows:
- `algorithms/` contains the implemented models and the corresponding example code;
- `base_models/` contains the basic models (GCN);
- `dataset/` contains the necessary dataset files;
- `utils/` contains:
    * loading and splitting the data (`data_loader.py`);
    * contains various utilities (`utils.py`).
